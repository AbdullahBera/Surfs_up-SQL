# Climate Analysis 

## Overview of the Analysis 

I analyze the weather of Oahu for the months of June and December from a given SQLite database file by an investor. In jupyter notebook using SQLAlchemy I analyze the data. This analysis is diveded into two parts; in the first part I provide a summary statistics for the months of June and December, in the second part delve further into the data to provide additional queries and a much comprehensive data analysis. In the results section of my analysis folder I underscore three major points from my analysis. Furthermore, I continue my analysis by concluding in the summary section the results of the additional queries I generated.
