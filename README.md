# Climate Analysis 

## Overview of the Analysis 

I analyze the weather of Oahu for the months of June and December from a given SQLite database file by an investor. In jupyter notebook using SQLAlchemy I analyze the data. This analysis is diveded into two parts; in the first part I provide a summary statistics for the months of June and December, in the second part delve further into the data to provide additional queries and a much comprehensive data analysis. 

### Objective of the Analysis 

The main purpose of this analysis is to conduct a weather analysis in order to decide wheather opening a Surf shop in Oahu is profitable. Many businesses don't consider in depth analysis' of the market, and rather like to believe in their instincts and what people say. It is crucially important to lay down an comprehensive analysis of the market and its potentials before agreeing to enter it.
